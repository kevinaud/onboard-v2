### **Iteration 11: Final Documentation and Polish**

**Goal:** Finalize the project with user-facing documentation and a review of all output.

1.  **Create `README.md`:**
    *   Write a clear, concise `README.md` for the `onboard-pro` project.
    *   Include the one-liner for macOS/Linux/WSL.
    *   Provide the detailed, multi-step instructions for the Windows host setup process.
    *   Explain the purpose of the project and its architecture.

2.  **Review User-Facing Text:**
    *   Go through every string literal passed to `IUserInteraction` methods (`WriteHeader`, `WriteSuccess`, etc.).
    *   Ensure the language is clear, helpful, and consistent across all steps and orchestrators.

3.  **Error Handling Review:**
    *   Review the `try/catch` block in `Program.cs` and the general error handling in the orchestrators. Ensure that if a step fails, the application exits gracefully with a meaningful error message.
